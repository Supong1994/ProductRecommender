# ProductRecommender
This project is a user-based collaborative filtering recommendation system designed to suggest shopping products to users based on their historical preferences and product ratings. It mimics real-world e-commerce platforms like Amazon or Flipkart, where recommendations are made using similarity in user behavior.
